# 🏝 Days until Summer Holidays

Only recently I had to go back to school, and while I was in a break, I asked myself a simple question:
> How many more days do I have to go to school until summer holidays are back again?


As you may or may not have guessed, this question would be relatively simply answered by just looking into the calendar and roughly counting the weeks.
But what that method wouldn't be very **precise** as it doesn't include special days off from your school, public holidays or regular holidays like the christmas break.<br/>

With "Days until Summer Holidays" my goal is to overcome this inaccuracy while still maintaining a simple user inteface and in later development stages also adding in fancy stats. 
(something like how many more math lessons you have would be funny I guess 😄)
